# ImaGenerator

ImaGenerator is an Dall-E 2.0 based image generator using the basics of MERN stack.
Here, the every prompt provided would generate a preview of the image generated and if liked by the user, may be shared with the community and saved in MongoDB.
Cloudinary has been used in this project to migrate the images in the cloud, for easy media management.
